### - I supposed that the cluster is already setup and running 

# Verify Kubernetes Cluster is Accessible

Make sure your Kubernetes cluster is running and accessible:

```bash
kubectl cluster-info
```

# Ensure Helm Version is Installed (Helm 3 or above)

```bash
helm version
```

# Add ingress-nginx Helm repository

```bash
helm repo add ingress-nginx https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx
helm repo update
```

# Install the ingress-nginx Controller

You can optionally specify the version of ingress-nginx to ensure compatibility with your setup.

```bash
helm install ingress-nginx ingress-nginx/ingress-nginx \
    --namespace ingress-nginx \
    --create-namespace \
    --version X.Y.Z \    # Replace X.Y.Z with a specific version if needed
    --set controller.service.externalTrafficPolicy=Local
```

# Verify the Installation

Check the running resources such as pods, services, and the ingress controller:

```bash
kubectl get all -n ingress-nginx
```

- You should see pods, services, and the ingress controller running.

# Apply Ingress Configuration

Apply your ingress configuration file located at `helm/ingress/ingress.yaml`:

```bash
kubectl apply -f helm/ingress/ingress.yaml
```

- The `ingress.yaml` should define the ingress rules to route traffic to your services. Make sure that this file contains the correct domain and service configurations.

# Confirm Ingress Setup

Run the following command to confirm that the ingress resource has been created successfully:

```bash
kubectl get ingress
```

# Verify NGINX Ingress Controller Status

Ensure the ingress-nginx controller pods are up and running:

```bash
kubectl get pods -n ingress-nginx
```

# Check External Access to the Ingress Controller

To get the external IP address of the NGINX ingress controller service, use the following command:

```bash
kubectl get svc -n ingress-nginx
```

- This will show the external IP assigned to your ingress controller. You can then use it to access services exposed via ingress.

# Test Ingress Connectivity

You can test the ingress connectivity by using `curl` or accessing the service via the browser (replace `<EXTERNAL_IP_OR_DOMAIN>` with the IP or DNS of your ingress):

```bash
curl http://<EXTERNAL_IP_OR_DOMAIN>
```

- You should get a response from the service if the ingress is configured correctly.
