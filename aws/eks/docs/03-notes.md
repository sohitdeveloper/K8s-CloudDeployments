# Kubernetes PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) Permissions and OIDC Configuration

## Overview

When using Kubernetes on AWS, managing PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs) with AWS Elastic Block Store (EBS) requires specific IAM permissions and configurations. This guide explains the need for these permissions and the importance of setting up OpenID Connect (OIDC) for your EKS cluster.

## Why We Need to Grant IAM Permissions for PVCs

To dynamically provision EBS volumes with a PVC in Kubernetes, the worker nodes require IAM permissions to create and manage EBS volumes. These actions are performed by the AWS EBS CSI driver, which needs the following permissions:

- `ec2:CreateVolume`
- `ec2:AttachVolume`
- `ec2:DeleteVolume`
- `ec2:DetachVolume`
- `ec2:DescribeVolumes`

### Steps to Grant Permissions

1. **Find and Select the IAM Role:**

   - Identify the IAM role associated with your EKS worker nodes. For example: `eksctl-daas-cluster-nodegroup-daas-NodeInstanceRole-Av6VFmLbIQCs`.

2. **Attach the Necessary Policy:**
   - Go to the IAM console, select the role, and click on "Attach policies."
   - Search for `AmazonEC2FullAccess` and attach this policy to grant the required permissions.

## Why Configure OIDC for Your EKS Cluster

Configuring OIDC for your EKS cluster allows Kubernetes to securely manage access to AWS resources on behalf of your applications. It enables fine-grained permissions using IAM roles for service accounts, ensuring that only the necessary permissions are granted to each workload.

## Why We Need to Add `PGDATA` Environment Variable

When using a PVC to mount an EBS volume for PostgreSQL, the mount point (`/var/lib/postgresql/data`) may contain a `lost+found` directory, which causes PostgreSQL initialization to fail. To avoid this, we set the `PGDATA` environment variable to a subdirectory:

```yaml
- name: PGDATA
  value: /var/lib/postgresql/data/pgdata
```
````

This ensures that PostgreSQL initializes in a clean directory, preventing conflicts with system-generated files like `lost+found`.

# In your EKS cluster, specifying the --platform linux/amd64 tag is essential during the Docker build because the cluster likely runs on nodes with AMD64 architecture.

```bash
docker build --platform linux/amd64 -t <username/image-name> .
```

## Conclusion

Properly configuring IAM permissions and OIDC is essential for securely managing PVCs and other resources in AWS. Additionally, specifying the `PGDATA` variable ensures smooth PostgreSQL initialization when using mounted volumes.
